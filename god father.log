Give me a chance to redeem myself, and I will sin, no more.
You are so loved, Don Tommasino. Why was I so feared and you so loved? I want to do good. What betrayed me? My mind? My heart? Why do I condemn myself so?
I tried, to keep everything from coming to this, but it's not possible, not in this world.
I'm asking for your order.
That's the price you pay, for the life you choose.

Let us remember the person--Francis Ford Coppola, a great director.
