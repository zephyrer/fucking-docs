    <p>FIXME: Page under construction; mostly complete now, but may need some clarifications.</p>
<p>I will add to this as time permits; please bear with me. My intent
is to provide answers to some remarkably similar, but independently
asked, questions which have appeared recently, on the MinGW-Users and
MinGW-MSYS lists.</p>
<hr>
<p>
</p>
<h4 id="toc0">Introduction</h4>
<p>This Mini-HOWTO attempts to answer the FAQ: <em>"Why can't the MinGW compilers find my project's header files?"</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/index.html#Top">CPP Section</a> of the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/index.html#dir">GCC Manual</a> indicates that header files may be located in <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Search-Path.html#Search-Path">the following directories</a>:--</p>
<pre>On a normal Unix system, if you do not instruct it otherwise,
[GCC] will look for headers requested with #include &lt;file&gt; in:

     /usr/local/include
     libdir/gcc/target/version/include
     /usr/target/include
     /usr/include

For C++ programs, it will also look in /usr/include/g++-v3, first.</pre><p> Of course, the <a class="" style="" href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MinGW">MinGW</a> ports of GCC target Microsoft's Windows system, which is <em><strong>not</strong></em> a <em>"normal UNIX system"</em>.  Nevertheless, many users, particularly those coming from a UNIX or GNU/Linux background, and especially when they use <a class="" style="" href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS">MSYS</a> to emulate a UNIX file system model on their MS-Windows hosts, are surprised to find that <a class="" style="" href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MinGW">MinGW</a>, using its default configuration, does <em><strong>not</strong></em> automatically search for header files in these directories.</p>
<h4 id="toc1">MinGW's Default Include Path</h4>
<p>So, if <a class="" style="" href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MinGW">MinGW</a> doesn't search in these <em>"normal"</em> directories, where <em><strong>does</strong></em> it search?</p>
<p>Before answering this, it may be useful to understand <em>why</em> <a class="" style="" href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MinGW">MinGW</a>
doesn't search in these directories. Firstly, on a native MS-Windows
host, these directories do not typically exist; the multiply rooted
nature of the file system means that such path names would be
ambiguous. Secondly, since <a class="" style="" href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MinGW">MinGW</a> itself is <em>not</em> a suite of <a class="" style="" href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS">MSYS</a> applications, even if such directories are created in the <a class="" style="" href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS">MSYS</a> environment, <a class="" style="" href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MinGW">MinGW</a> would have no means to locate them.</p>
<p>Thus, to avoid imposing draconian restrictions on how users install <a class="" style="" href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MinGW">MinGW</a>, the maintainers have chosen to adopt a restricted search paradigm, which is determined on the basis of where <a class="" style="" href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MinGW">MinGW</a> is itself installed.  The actual search path, for any specific installation of <a class="" style="" href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MinGW">MinGW</a> may be determined, by running the compiler itself, with the <em>"-v"</em> option; typically, for a GCC-3.4.5 installation in <em>c:/mingw</em>:--</p>
<pre>$ touch foo.c bar.cpp

$ gcc -v -c foo.c
:
#include "..." search starts here:
#include &lt;...&gt; search starts here:
 c:/mingw/bin/../lib/gcc/mingw32/3.4.5/../../../../include
 c:/mingw/bin/../lib/gcc/mingw32/3.4.5/include
End of search list.
:

$ g++ -v -c bar.cpp
:
#include "..." search starts here:
#include &lt;...&gt; search starts here:
 c:/mingw/bin/../lib/gcc/mingw32/3.4.5/../../../../include/c++/3.4.5
 c:/mingw/bin/../lib/gcc/mingw32/3.4.5/../../../../include/c++/3.4.5/mingw32
 c:/mingw/bin/../lib/gcc/mingw32/3.4.5/../../../../include/c++/3.4.5/backward
 c:/mingw/bin/../lib/gcc/mingw32/3.4.5/../../../../include
 c:/mingw/bin/../lib/gcc/mingw32/3.4.5/include
End of search list.
:</pre>
<p>This raw format output, as displayed by the compilers, may be
difficult for human readers to interpret. Thus, it may be helpful to
reduce it to canonical path forms:--</p>
<pre>$ gcc -v -c foo.c 2&gt;&amp;1 | sed ':1;s,/[^/.][^/]*/\.\./,/,;t 1'
:
#include "..." search starts here:
#include &lt;...&gt; search starts here:
 c:/mingw/include
 c:/mingw/lib/gcc/mingw32/3.4.5/include
End of search list.
:

$ g++ -v -c bar.cpp 2&gt;&amp;1 | sed ':1;s,/[^/.][^/]*/\.\./,/,;t 1'
:
#include "..." search starts here:
#include &lt;...&gt; search starts here:
 c:/mingw/include/c++/3.4.5
 c:/mingw/include/c++/3.4.5/mingw32
 c:/mingw/include/c++/3.4.5/backward
 c:/mingw/include
 c:/mingw/lib/gcc/mingw32/3.4.5/include
End of search list.
:</pre>
<h4 id="toc2">Other Directories Searched by Default</h4>
<p>The minimal list of directories, identified as described above, specifies the <em><strong>only</strong></em> locations which will be searched <em><strong>by default</strong></em>, for system header files or for headers associated with user installed libraries; however, there is <em><strong>one</strong></em>
exception. Astute readers may have noticed that the include file search
path is itemised in a pair of sequential lists, with the second being
concatenated to the first; however, the first, identified as the <em>#include "..." search</em> list appears to be empty.  In reality, this apparent emptiness is possibly misleading; unless the user specifies the <em>"-I-"</em> option when invoking GCC, this list contains <em>exactly</em> one directory: the directory in which the source file containing the <em>#include "file"</em> directive resides.</p>
<p>Notice that this one additional directory is <em><strong>not</strong></em> searched for headers specified with the <em>#include &lt;file&gt;</em> form of the <em>#include</em> directive; it applies only for those headers specified using the <em>#include "file"</em>
form of the directive. Also note that the location of this additional
directory is not fixed; it is dependent on the location of the source
file being compiled, and, while unique for each individual source file,
it may vary even within the compilation scope for any project, <em>and even within the scope of a single translation unit</em>, if multiple source files are distributed among different directories in the project's source hierarchy.</p>
<p>To clarify this point, let us consider a trivial example. Suppose
that we have a small project, which provides all of it's sources in a
single directory; among them we might have:--</p>
<pre>~/src
   :
   :--- bar.h
   :
   :--- foo.c
   :--- foo.h
   :</pre><p> Further suppose that <em>"foo.c"</em> <em>#include</em>s <em>"foo.h"</em>:--</p>
<pre>/* foo.c
 */
 :
#include "foo.h"
 :</pre><p> and that <em>"foo.h"</em>, in turn, <em>#include</em>s <em>"bar.h"</em>:--</p>
<pre>/* foo.h
 */
 :
#include "bar.h"
 :</pre><p> With this arrangement, we may create a build directory which is a sibling of <em>"src"</em>, and with that as current directory, we may compile <em>"foo.c"</em>:--</p>
<pre>$ mkdir ~/build
$ cd ~/build
$ gcc -c ../src/foo.c
$ </pre><p>
and we might have every expectation that it will compile correctly; it
certainly should have no problem finding the pair of header files, <em>"foo.h"</em> and <em>"bar.h"</em>.</p>
<p>Now, suppose that the project grows, to such a size that we decide to separate our headers into a subdirectory of <em>"src"</em>:--</p>
<pre>~/src
   :
   :--- foo.c
   :
   :--- hdr
   :     :
   :     :--- bar.h
   :     :--- foo.h
   :     :</pre>
<p>After making this rearrangement, if we again try to compile <em>"foo.c"</em>, we will likely see errors resulting from the failure to locate the header file <em>"foo.h"</em>:--</p>
<pre>$ gcc -c ../src/foo.c
../src/foo.c:3:17: foo.h: No such file or directory
 :
$</pre><p> To correct this, we must also modify <em>"foo.c"</em>, to reflect the relocation of the header files:--</p>
<pre>/* foo.c
 */
 :
#include "hdr/foo.h"
 :</pre><p> and this should be sufficient to again let us compile <em>"foo.c"</em> successfully:--</p>
<pre>$ gcc -c ../src/foo.c
$ </pre><p> Note here, that we did <em><strong>not</strong></em> make any corresponding change in <em>"bar.h"</em>; that would have been wrong!  The rule is that, in any <em>#include</em> directive of the form:--</p>
<pre>#include "path/file"</pre><p> <em>path</em> must be a <em><strong>relative</strong></em> path, and it must be relative to the directory in which the file containing the pertinent <em>#include</em> directive is itself located.  In our example, since <em>"foo.h"</em> and <em>"bar.h"</em>
are still in the same directory, searches for files included by either
will commence in that same directory. If we had changed <em>"foo.h"</em>, in a manner similar to the change we made in <em>"foo.c"</em>, then <em>"foo.h"</em> would have attempted to <em>#include</em> the file <em>"~</em>/<em>src</em>/<em>hdr</em>/<em>hdr</em>/<em>bar.h"</em>, instead of the intended <em>"~</em>/<em>src</em>/<em>hdr</em>/<em>bar.h"</em>.</p>
<h4 id="toc3">Including Headers from Directories which are Not Searched by Default</h4>
<p>While the default header search paths may suffice for many simple
projects, as project complexity grows, it will often become more
convenient to collect header files into a central directory which is <em><strong>not</strong></em>
in the default search path; this is particularly true of projects which
provide, and possibly install, one or more function libraries, either
exclusively for their own use, or maybe even for general use by other
projects. In such cases, GCC must be <em><strong>explicitly</strong></em> notified, by specifying appropriate command line options, to identify the additional directories in which to search.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/index.html#dir">GCC Manual</a> documents several <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.5/gcc/Preprocessor-Options.html#Preprocessor-Options">options</a>, which may be used to specify directories to search for header files; of these, the most widely used is the <em>"-I DIR"</em>
option. As an example of its use, let us reconsider the previous
example, with the project source files organised within the hierarchy:--</p>
<pre>~/src
   :
   :--- foo.c
   :
   :--- hdr
   :     :
   :     :--- bar.h
   :     :--- foo.h
   :     :</pre><p> but this time, we will <em><strong>not</strong></em> adapt <em>foo.c</em> to locate <em>foo.h</em> using the default include file search path:--</p>
<pre>/* foo.c
 */
 :
#include "foo.h"
 :</pre>
<p>As we saw previously, if we try to compile this unmodified <em>foo.c</em>, without explicitly specifying any header search path, the compilation will fail:--</p>
<pre>$ gcc -c ../src/foo.c
../src/foo.c:3:17: foo.h: No such file or directory
 :
$</pre>
<p>Previously, we corrected this failure by modifying <em>foo.c</em>, to bring <em>foo.h</em> into the default <em>#include "..."</em> search path.  This time, we will correct it, not by modifying <em>foo.c</em>, but by <em><strong>explicitly</strong></em> adding our project's local <em>hdr</em> directory to the search path, when we invoke GCC to compile <em>foo.c</em>:--</p>
<pre>$ gcc -I ../src/hdr -c ../src/foo.c
$</pre><p> which, we may observe, again results in successful compilation.</p>
<h4 id="toc4">Using Headers Provided with Locally Installed External Libraries</h4>
<p>Many projects have dependencies on external libraries, which are <em>not</em> provided by a standard <a class="" style="" href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MinGW">MinGW</a>
installation. Users who wish to build the applications provided by such
projects must first install the appropriate prerequisite libraries.
Such libraries are referred to as <em>"locally installed libraries"</em>, and they must be installed such that MinGW's GCC can readily locate both the libraries themselves, <em>and</em> any header files installed as prerequisites for specifying the interface to the library functions.</p>
<p>The installation of such external libraries may be viewed as a
challenge, for some users. Typically, and particularly in the case of
library packages originally developed for Unix-like platforms, such
libraries would be installed into the /<em>usr</em>/<em>local</em>/<em>...</em> directory hierarchy.  However, as we have seen above, <a class="" style="" href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MinGW">MinGW</a>'s
GCC does not consider any such hierarchy in its default search paths,
either for header files, or for libraries. Thus, the challenge is to
choose an installation strategy which achieves a satisfactory
compromise between:--
</p><ol>
<li>Installing directly into <a class="" style="" href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MinGW">MinGW</a>'s own standard <em>&lt;mingw-root&gt;</em>/<em>include</em> and <em>&lt;mingw-root&gt;</em>/<em>lib</em>
directory hierarchies; this offers the advantage that the libraries,
and their associated header files, are placed directly into <a class="" style="" href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MinGW">MinGW</a> GCC's default search paths, so there is no additional burden placed on the user, to add additional <em>"-I DIR"</em>
options, throughout the build systems of any project using an external
library. However, while perhaps being the simplest option, this
strategy is not without disadvantages:--
<ul>
<li>The external library components are intermingled, within the file system hierarchy, with <a class="" style="" href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MinGW">MinGW</a>'s own standard components; it may not be straightforward to segregate them later, should this ever be necessary.</li>
<li>Should the user wish to maintain <em>side-by-side</em> <a class="" style="" href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MinGW">MinGW</a>
installations, at differing release point versions, say, then the
external library installations will need to be duplicated, within each
of the separate <a class="" style="" href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MinGW">MinGW</a> installation hierarchies.</li>
<li>If the <a class="" style="" href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MinGW">MinGW</a>
installation hierarchy is purged, in preparation for a clean
re-installation, then any locally installed external libraries will
also be purged, and if subsequently needed, will have to be reinstalled.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Creating a separate directory hierarchy, into which all external
library packages are installed; this mitigates the disadvantages of
option (1), but introduces its own drawbacks:--
<ul>
<li>The header files and libraries are no longer in <a class="" style="" href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MinGW">MinGW</a> GCC's default search paths; thus the user <em><strong>must</strong></em> make provision to pass the appropriate <em>"-I DIR"</em>, (and associated <em>"-L DIR"</em>), options to GCC, through his own projects' build systems. (This may be mitigated, in turn, by customising the <em><a class="" style="" href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/SpecsFileHOWTO">GCC Specs File</a></em>, to supply the necessary options <em>automatically</em>, for <em>all</em> invocations of GCC, or by appropriately defining GCC's <em><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Environment-Variables.html#Environment-Variables">CPATH</a></em> and <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Environment-Variables.html#Environment-Variables">related environment variables</a>).</li>
<li>Although now segregated from the <a class="" style="" href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MinGW">MinGW</a>
standard library and header components, all external library packages
are still intermixed, one with another, in a common installation
hierarchy; nonetheless, this is often considered to be an acceptable
compromise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As a variation on option (2), create a separate directory hierarchy, for <em>each</em> and <em>every individual</em>
external library package to be locally installed; this mitigates all of
the disadvantages of option (1), and the package intermixing of option
(2), but it incurs an alternative penalty:--
<ul>
<li>As with option (2), appropriate <em>"-I DIR"</em> and <em>"-L DIR"</em>
options must be added to each GCC invocation; however, whereas option
(2) requires only one additional path of each type, this option
requires an additional one of each type, for <em>each</em> and <em>every</em> external library to be deployed.  (While this may still be achieved by appropriate customisation of the <em><a class="" style="" href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/SpecsFileHOWTO">GCC Specs File</a></em>, or by appropriately specifying the <em><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Environment-Variables.html#Environment-Variables">CPATH</a></em> and <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Environment-Variables.html#Environment-Variables">related environment variables</a>, the additional complexity, and maintenance overhead, may be considered unacceptable to many users).</li>
</ul>
</li>
