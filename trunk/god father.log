she was the light of my life.
that I cannot do.
I'll give you anything you ask.
Because the man who doesn't spend time with his family...can never be a real man.
I'll make so much trouble for you, you won't know what hit you.
I don't lile to use his name unless it's necessary.
Come with me, I want to show you something really beautiful.
Just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man...that it's not all dollars and cents.
She was beautiful.She was young, she was innoncent!
...and a man in my position can't afford...to be made to look ridiculous!
Now you get the hell outta here!
...With the money they earn...they can buy more police and political power. Then they come after us.
Why do you come to me?
...They talk when they should listen.
what done is done.
How get things ever get so far?
Women and children can be careless, but not man.
I'll handle it, I told you I can handleit, I'll handle it.
I worked my whole life-- I don't apologize to take care of my family...and I refuced to be a fool...dancing on s string held by all those big shots.
Now, listen, who ever comes to you with this Barzini meeting...he's the traitor. Don't forget that.(后来在Vito的葬礼上，叛徒出现了，泰西欧 Tessio)

Give me a chance to redeem myself, and I will sin, no more.
You are so loved, Don Tommasino. Why was I so feared and you so loved? I want to do good. What betrayed me? My mind? My heart? Why do I condemn myself so?
I tried, to keep everything from coming to this, but it's not possible, not in this world.
I'm asking for your order.
That's the price you pay, for the life you choose.

Let us remember the person--Francis Ford Coppola, a great director.
维多.卡里昂(Vito Corleone)――在跟孙子(安东尼，后来的歌唱家)的玩耍中去世，这样，也算是其人生的一个完美结局。
麦克――好像喜欢用白色手巾，在西西里的时候，遇见阿波洛尼亚之后便与之结婚，足见也是一个浪漫主义者。
每当麦克展开大屠杀时，他基本都身处典雅、神圣之地。
巴西尼――索拉索被杀后，由于媒体纰漏，接收调查
汤姆.希金(Tom Hagen)
强尼.方亭
卢卡.布拉西
泰西欧
克里曼杀
索拉索
卡洛――康妮之夫
汤玛西诺――麦克逃亡时，应噶是住他家
法布里奇欧――麦克杀掉索拉索后逃离至西西里的保镖之一
卡罗――保镖之二，后来成为麦克的主要跟随者。
阿波洛尼亚――麦克之妻，被保镖之一暗杀。
山提尼(Santino)在听到妹妹的电话后，赶往其妹家，路上中伏，亡。自此，麦克出山。让人震撼的是，老柯里昂在听到这个消息后只是说了句"I want no acts of vengeance".而维多要求将山提尼的遗体化妆好，只为其夫人(即山提尼之母)不要见到儿子的惨状.
凯(Kay)
弗雷多(Fredo)
西西欧(Ciccio)：杀害Vito全家的人，后被Vito剖腹。
柯梅拉神父(Father Carmelo)


麦克做教父的过程似乎很简单，把所有的对手都杀掉便是最简单而便捷的办法。当然这个过程也许是非常艰难的。
